# Dataset Labeling Demo

This project demonstrates how to create, label, and export datasets for AI training.

## Tools
- **CVAT** for image annotation
- Exported formats: YOLOv8, COCO

## Process
1. Imported 50+ retail shelf images.
2. Annotated objects: `rack`, `primary shelf`, `different`.
3. Exported in YOLO + COCO formats.

## Exports
- `/exports/annotations_yolo/`
- `/exports/annotations_coco/`

## Why this matters
Being able to generate datasets in multiple formats is essential for real AI/ML workflows.
